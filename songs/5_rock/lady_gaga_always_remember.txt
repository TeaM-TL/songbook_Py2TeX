title: Always remember us this way  
authors: Lady Gaga

That arizona sky burning in your eyes | a F
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire |C G
It's buried in my soul like California gold | a F
You found the light in me that I couldn't find | C G 

 So when I'm all choked up | F
 But I can't find the words | C
 Every time you say goodbye | a 
 Baby, it hurts | G
 When the sun goes down | F G a 
 And the band won't play |F G C
 I'll always remember us this way  | F G C

Lovers in the night | a
Poets trying to write | F
We don't know how to rhyme | C
But, damn, we try | G
But all I really know | a
You're where I wanna go | F
The part of me that's you will never die | C G

chorus

Oh yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory baby | F
ooo | C B  F G 

chorus

When you look at mae | F G a
And the whole word fades | F G C
I'll always remember us this way | F G a
