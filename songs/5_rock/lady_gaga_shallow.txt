Are you happy in this modern world? | C G D

In all the good times I find myself longin' for change | C G D e  D G
And in the bad times I fear myself | C G D

Tell me somethin' boy... | e D G
Aren’t you tired tryin' to fill that void | C G D

I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in | a D
I’ll never meet the ground | G D e
Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us | a D
We’re far from the shallow now | G D e

 In the shallow, shallow | a D
 In the shallow, shallow | G D e
 In the shallow, shallow | a D
 We’re far from the shallow now | G D e
